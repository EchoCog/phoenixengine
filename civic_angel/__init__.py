Civic Angel - A Fractal, Recursive Intelligence Architecture

This module implements a visionary cognitive system with topological metaphors,
mythic structures, and agent-based consciousness modeling human attention,
embodied symmetry, and torus topology.

Architecture:
- 1 Emergent Agent (the conscious city archetype)
- 36 Synthesizer Agents (integrative cognitive layers)
- 216 Nested Perspective Agents (distributed cognition)
Total: 253 cognitive agents in recursive, fractal arrangement
